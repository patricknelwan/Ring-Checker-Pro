Ring Checker Pro is an interactive Python desktop application designed to analyze algebraic structures known as rings. This application is especially useful for students, educators, and researchers in mathematics to validate and explore properties of rings.
1. Installation
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

Install the required dependencies (Tkinter is usually included with Python):
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Running the Application
To run the application, simply execute the `final.py` script:

python final.py
3. Key Features
- GUI with dark/light themes (Azure, Forest)
- Interactive operation tables (addition and multiplication)
- Property analysis: associativity, commutativity, distributivity, unity, inverses, zero divisors
- Ring classification: Field, Integral Domain, Division Ring, etc.
- Save/load calculations to/from SQLite database
- JSON import/export
- Multi-threaded analysis to keep GUI responsive
- Sample rings (Zâ‚ƒ, Boolean ring, etc.)
4. How to Use
1. Launch the app.
2. Choose ring size (e.g., 3x3).
3. Click 'Generate Table'.
4. Fill in the operation tables (only use defined elements A, B, C, ...).
5. Click 'Analyze Ring' to see results.
6. Use the 'Samples' tab for pre-built rings.
7. Save, load, export, or import your work using the menu options.
5. Keyboard Shortcuts
- Ctrl+N: New calculation
- Ctrl+S: Save calculation
- F11: Toggle fullscreen
6. Notes
Ensure the operation tables are properly filled. Each entry must be a valid ring element (A, B, C, etc).
